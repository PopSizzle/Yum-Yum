Sprinkle all the chicken with salt and keep warm for up to 15 minutes, until ready to serve.',

Spread the underside of the top bun generously with more of the mayo and place on top of the chicken, mayo side down. Serve while the chicken is still warm.'

      'Bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat, stirring often. Add the apple (if the strawberries are under-ripe, add half of the apple; if they are very ripe, add the whole apple) and blueberries and continue to cook the mixture at a rolling boil, stirring occasionally, until the jam reaches 220 degrees on a candy thermometer. This should take 25 to 35 minutes. Skim and discard any foam that rises to the top. Test the consistency of the jam by putting some jam on a plate and placing it in the freezer for 5 to 10 minutes, until cool, to see if it jells. If the jam doesn’t quite jell, cook it’s a little longer and test it again. Allow the mixture to cool to room temperature and then store covered in the refrigerator.  It will keep refrigerated for at least 2 weeks. To keep the jam longer, pack and seal in canning jars according to the manufacturer’s instructions.'
